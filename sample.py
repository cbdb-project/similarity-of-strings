# compare_by_each_chars - Hongsu Wang
# Description:
#    Compare two strings by using each of their characters
#  Reference link:
#    None
#  Input:
#    The first two variables - the strings need to be compared - string
#    The third varible - the varibles for this algorithm - list
#  Output:
#    The first varible - similarity degree - number
#    The second varible - [how many characters matched, which characters matched] - list
